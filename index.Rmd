# Data types

.pull-left[
## Vectors: 
- basic building blocks of R

```{r}
test_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
test_character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
```

- Vectors can also be named:
```{r}
names(test_vector) <- c("one", "two", "three", 
                        "four", "five")
test_vector
```
]
--
.pull-right[
## Dataframes/tibbles:
- essentially tables

```{r}
library(tibble)
df <- tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))
df
```
]
---

# Reading in data

The `readr` R package is your friend here. Lots of functions that are useful:

- `read_csv()`: comma separated files
- `read_tsv()`: tab separated files
- `read_xlsx()`: excel files, can specify what sheet to read in

--

Useful cheatsheet: [https://readr.tidyverse.org](https://readr.tidyverse.org)
--


## Cleaning up column names

Column names can frequently be messy, e.g. `age.at death` instead of `age_at_death`. The janitor R package can help with this. Install it using
```
install.packages("janitor")

# then run the clean_names() function on your dataframe
df <- clean_names(df)
```
- Check the janitor documentation for many other useful functions!
---

# Subsetting & manipulating data 

Subsetting data is a common task in R. The `dplyr` package can help with this. Some useful functions:
- `filter()`: filter rows based on some condition
- `select()`: select columns
    - can be used with `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `contains()`, `matches()`, `one_of()`, `everything()`
- `mutate()`: add new columns
- `arrange()`: sort rows
- `group_by()`: group by a variable (frequently followed by other functions like `summarize()` or `tally()`)

--

## Piping data
.pull-left[
I may want to apply multiple of these functions to the same data in succession.
I could either do this in a nested fashion, but this is very hard to read:
```
mutate(filter(select(df, x, y), x > 2), z = x + y)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
Alternatively, I can pipe the data using the `|>` operator (`command + shift + m` in RStudio):
```
df |> 
  select(x, y) |> 
  filter(x > 2) |> 
  mutate(z = x + y)
```
]

---
# Dealing with dates

Dates are a common data type that can be a pain to work with as there are many formats. The `lubridate` package can help with this. Some functions to parse date-times:
.pull-left[
```{r warning=F}
library(lubridate)
date <- ymd(20221215)
date
```

Extract the day (similar functions exist for year, month, hour, second, etc):
```{r}
day(date)
```

Extract the weekday:
```{r}
wday(date, label = TRUE)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
To overwrite the date column in a dataframe with the formated date I can thus do:
```{r}
df <- tibble(date = c("20201215", "20201216"))
df$date <- ymd(df$date)
df
```
]

---
# Excel time
.pull-left[
Time is stored as serial numbers. Time starts on January 0th 1900 at time 00:00:00 
- To convert from excel time to a readable time use the `convertToDateTime()` function
- remember to add the tz argument to specify the timezone
```{r}
time <- convertToDateTime(44239.5, 
                          tz='Canada/Eastern')
time
```

We can get the year, month, day using `as.Date()`
```{r}
as.Date(time)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
We can calculate the time between two times by substracting one from the other
```{r}
time1 <- convertToDateTime(45336.5, 
                           tz='Canada/Eastern')
time2 <- convertToDateTime(44239.5, 
                           tz='Canada/Eastern')

time1 - time2
```

# Sample dataset: palmer penguins

.pull-left[

Penguin data collected from the palmer station in Antarctica.

```
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```
```{r echo=F}
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
head(penguins, n = 6)
```
]
.pull-right[
  <img src="images/lter_penguins.png" width="418" height="250" 
  style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
]
---
# Select
.pull-left-small[
  ## Select
  ```{r message=FALSE}
  library(dplyr)
  select(penguins, species, island) |> 
    head(n = 4)
  ```
]
--
.pull-right-big[
  ## Using `starts_with()`
  ```{r message=FALSE}
  select(penguins, species, island, starts_with("bill")) |> 
    head(n = 4)
  ```

Instead of `starts_with()` I could also use `ends_with()`, `contains()`, `matches()`, `one_of()`, `everything()`, etc.
]
---
# Filter rows
```{r message=FALSE}
filter(penguins, island == "Torgersen") |> head(n = 4)
```
--
.pull-left-55-inverse[
Filtering out missing values (NA's)
```{r}
select(penguins, species, island, sex) |> 
  filter(!is.na(sex)) |> head(n = 2)
```
]
--
.pull-right-55[
Combining conditions with `&` (and) or `|` (or) is easy.
```{r}
select(penguins, species, island, sex) |> 
  filter(island == "Torgersen" & !is.na(sex)) |> head(n = 2)
```
]
---

# Mutate: adding new columns or changing existing columns
.pull-left-55-inverse[
```{r message=FALSE}
mutate(penguins, 
       bill_length_log = log(bill_length_mm)) |> 
  select(bill_length_mm, bill_length_log)
```
]
--
.pull-right-55[
Let's impute those missing values in `bill_length_mm` with the mean value:
```{r}
mutate(penguins, bill_length_mm = 
    case_when(
      is.na(bill_length_mm) ~ mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
      TRUE ~ bill_length_mm
)) |> select(bill_length_mm) |> head(n = 4)

mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```
]
---
# Cleaning up messy data with mutate

# Exercise 1!
Try answering some of the following questions?
1. Do any of the islands have an imbalance in the number of male/female penguins?
  - Calculate the number of male and female penguins on each island
  - See if you can calculate the proportion of female penguins on each island
2. What is the average body mass of each species?
3. What is the average body mass of each species on each island?
4. Impute the missing values for the `body_mass_g` column in a species and sex specific manner (you will need `group_by` and `mutate` for this)

# Plotting: base R vs ggplot
.pull-left[
```{r fig.height = 5}
plot(x = penguins$bill_length_mm, 
     y = penguins$bill_depth_mm, 
     col = penguins$species)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r fig.height=4, warning=F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
           color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```
]
---
# Adding regression lines
Let's say I want to add a regression line for each species to the plot. In base R I would do:
```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
plot(x = penguins$bill_length_mm, y = penguins$bill_depth_mm, col = penguins$species)
abline(lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie", ]), col = "red")
abline(lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins[penguins$species == "Chinstrap", ]), col = "green")
abline(lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins[penguins$species == "Gentoo", ]), col = "blue")
```
---
# The benefit of ggplot
.pull-left[
Several issues with the base R approach:
1. I need to manually add a line for each species
2. I need to subset the penguins dataframe for each species (e.g. `penguins[penguins$species == "Gentoo", ]`)
3. I need to manually make sure my colours match, notice the discrepancy in point and regression line colours
4. I need to manually add a figure legend
]

.pull-right[
## Using ggplot
```{r warning=F, message=F, fig.height=4}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
           color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
]
---
# Some more advantages
.pull-left-55-inverse[
Lets say I actually wanted to know the difference in bill depth by species, I can modify our earlier code
```
ggplot(penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm,
      color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```
]
--
.pull-right-55[
and set `x = species` and replace `geom_point()` with `geom_boxplot()`:
```{r warning = F, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
]
--
.pull-right-55[
In base R I would have had to start over with `boxplot(bill_depth_mm ~ species, data = penguins)`
]

# What is ggplot anyways?
.pull-left-small[
### *gg stands for Grammar of Graphics*
- It is a way of thinking about how to build plots
- The idea is that you can build up a plot in layers, adding points, lines, labels, etc. as you go
- This makes it very easy to build complex plots.

### Data
- this is the data you want to plot

### Aesthetics
- this is how you want to map your data to the plot.
  - what variable do you want on the x- or y-axis
  - what variable do you want to use to colour the points, etc.

### Geometries
- this is the type of plot you want to make
  - points, lines, bars, boxplot, etc.

# Exercise 2!

Try answering some of the following questions:
1. What is the relationship between bill length and body mass?
  - Try plotting a scatterplot of bill length vs body mass
  - Try adding a regression line to the plot
  - How does this relationship differ by species?
2. Create a boxplot showing the difference in bill length by sex for each species (i.e. put species on the x-axis and bill length on the y-axis, and colour the plot by sex)
3. Create a barplot showing the number of penguins on each island (you will need the `group_by` and `tally` functions for this)

???

## Themes
- The default theme in ggplot has the grey background, there are many other options including `theme_minimal()`, `theme_bw()` etc. You can find a full list [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) 
- You can also modify individual elements of the plot using `theme()`, this function has 90+ arguments that allow you to override every aspect of the plot. E.g. the following will remove the x-ticks, angle the x-axis labels and move the legend to the bottom:
```
p + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
      axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), 
      legend.position = "bottom")
```

]

# Changing colours
I don't really like the colour palette in the previous plot. Let's manually change this, several ways of doing this:
.one_third[
Manually specifying the colours:
```{r warning = FALSE, message = F, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
my_cols <- c("female" = "blue", 
             "male" = "red")
p + scale_fill_manual(
  values = my_cols
  )
```
]
--
.one_third[
Using the `viridis` package:
```{r warning = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
library(viridis)
p + scale_fill_viridis_d()
```
]
--
.one_third[
Using the `RColorBrewer` package:
```{r warning = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
library(RColorBrewer)
p + scale_fill_brewer(
  palette = "Set3"
  )
```

There are lots of palettes for RColorBrewer, see [here](https://r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html)
]

---
# Exercise 3!
.pull-left[
1. Recreate the plot below and style this to your liking (e.g. change colour palette, theme, etc.).
Take a look at the documentation of the `theme` function for inspiration by running `?theme()`

```{r echo=F, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
penguins |> 
  group_by(species, island, sex) |>
  tally() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = n, fill = sex)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Species", y= "Number of penguins") +
  theme_bw()
```
]
.pull-right[
<ol start="2">
2. Create a scatterplot of bill length vs body mass, colour the points by species and add a regression line to the plot
</ol>
<ol start="3">
3. Now remove the regression line, but colour the points by the flipper_length_mm column
</ol>

# Multiple panels
Let's investigate whether the average weight of penguins has changed over the three year period our dataset spans, and how this varies by species and island. How can I make a plot to investigate this?

.pull-left[
First, let's calculate the average body mass of penguins by year, species and island
```{r warning = F, message = F}
df <- group_by(penguins, year, species, island) |> 
  summarise(Mean_body_mass=mean(body_mass_g))

head(df, n = 3)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
Incorporating the island through `facet_wrap`
```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.align='center', warning=F}
ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = Mean_body_mass, 
               colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~island) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))
```
]
---
# Even more panels
.pull-left[
We know that weight likely varies by sex, this is currently not accounted for in the earlier plot. How can I incorporate this?

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.align='center', warning=F, message=F}
df2 <- group_by(penguins, year, species, 
                island, sex) |> 
  filter(!is.na(sex)) |> 
  summarise(Mean_body_mass=mean(body_mass_g))

head(df2, n = 4)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
Option 1
```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=7, fig.align='center', warning=F, message=F}

# Long vs wide data format
.pull-left[
This is the first dataframe we plotted, is this wide or long?
```{r}
head(df2, n = 2)
```
The alternative would be a wide format, we might want this if we want to correlate the average weight of e.g. females and males
```{r}
library(tidyr)
df2_wide <- pivot_wider(df2, names_from = sex, 
                        values_from = Mean_body_mass) 
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.align='center', warning=F, message=F}
head(df2_wide, n = 2)

ggplot(df2_wide, aes(x = female, y = male)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

# Saving plots & patchwork
.pull-left[
There are several plotting functions in R:
- `pdf()`: saves a pdf
- `png()`: saves a png

All of them need to be closed with `dev.off()`. For example:
```
my_plot <- ggplot(df2_wide, aes(x = female, y = male)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

pdf("my-saved-plot.pdf", height = 3, width = 7)
  my_plot
dev.off()
```

Or I can plot multiple plots in the same pdf using
```
pdf("my-saved-plot.pdf", height = 3, width = 7)
  my_plot
  my_plot
dev.off()
```
]

Alternatively, we can combine plots using the patchwork package:
```{r echo=F}
my_plot <- ggplot(df2_wide, aes(x = female, y = male)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

```{r fig.height=2, message=F}
library(patchwork)
my_plot | my_plot # stack plots vertically
my_plot / my_plot # stack plots horizontally
```
