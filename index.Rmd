# Data types

### Vectors: 
- basic building blocks of R

```
test_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
test_character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
```

--

### Lists: 
- recursive vectors, a vector that can contain other vectors

```
test_list <- list(1, c(2, 3, 5), 3, 4, 5)
```

### Dataframes/tibbles
- essentially tables

```
library(tibble)
df <- tibble(x = 1:5,
             y = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
)
```

# Reading in data

The `readr` R package is your friend here. Lots of functions that are useful:

- `read_csv()`: comma separated files
- `read_tsv()`: tab separated files
- `read_xlsx()`: excel files, can specify what sheet to read in

## Cleaning up column names

Column names of data that is read in is frequently messy, e.g. `age.at death` instead of `age_at_death`. The janitor R package can help with this. Install it using
```
install.packages("janitor")

# then run the clean_names() function on your dataframe
df <- clean_names(df)
```
- Check the janitor documentation for many other useful functions!

# Dealing with dates

Dates are a common data type that can be a pain to work with as there are many formats. The `lubridate` package can help with this. Some functions to parse date-times:
```{r warning=F}
library(lubridate)
date <- ymd(20221215)
date
```

Extract the day (similar functions exist for year, month, hour, second, etc):
```{r}
day(date)
```

# Dealing with dates (cont'd)
To overwrite the date column in a dataframe with the formated date I can thus do:
```{r}
library(tibble)
df <- tibble(date = c("20201215", "20201216"))
df
```
--
```{r}
df$date <- ymd(df$date)
df
```
